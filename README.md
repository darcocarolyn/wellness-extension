# Wellness Extension
This was created during the ShellHacks 2023 event, where a team composed of myself and three others aimed to build something that could uplift users' spirits. We decided to develop a Google extension where users can have easy access to it.

The overall purpose of this Google extension is to promote wellness and positivity through postive messages, a 30 minute timer urging users to take a break, and reminding them of any tasks that they need to complete.

We built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and used techniques such as DOM manipulation and local storage to complete it
in 3 days.

However, we ran into some challenges where we wanted to add a database where users can send anonymous messages to their fellow users, but lacked the knowledge to implement it.
